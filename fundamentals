# What is System Design?

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, data flow,
and interactions of a system to meet business and technical requirements.

## Why System Design Matters
- Systems must scale with growing users and traffic
- High availability and fault tolerance are critical
- Poor design leads to outages, latency, and data inconsistency

## Key Goals of System Design
- Scalability
- Reliability
- Maintainability
- Performance
- Cost efficiency

## Example
Designing a URL shortener requires:
- Handling high read traffic
- Low latency redirects
- Unique and collision-free short URLs
